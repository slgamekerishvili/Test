\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 In the context of ss rati Anderson \\& Green 2018 show that personal bests act as reference points for players: a player ends a session whenever she sets her new personal best rating, and she plays longer otherwise.  Similar to our paper, they also study history dependent quitting behavior of players. Unlike our paper, they do not consider heterogenity in quitting behavior across players. We find that such heterogenity is present, and that it has serious implications for understanding quitting behavior of players and leveraging it for achieving various welfare goals. \par
